# BlockCertify Project Status

## 🎯 Project Overview
**BlockCertify** is a decentralized certificate authentication and verification platform built on blockchain technology. The system addresses issues of forgery, misplacement, and lengthy manual validation processes in academic and professional certificate verification.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Contracts (Solidity)
- **CertificateRegistry.sol**: Core contract for certificate issuance, verification, and management
- **UserManagement.sol**: Role-based access control and user management

### Backend (Node.js/Express)
- RESTful API server with MongoDB database
- JWT authentication and role-based authorization
- Blockchain integration services
- Certificate management endpoints

### Frontend (React.js)
- Material-UI design system
- Web3 wallet integration
- Responsive certificate verification interface
- Institution and user dashboards

2. **Smart Contracts**
   - CertificateRegistry contract with full functionality
   - UserManagement contract with role-based access
   - Deployment scripts for multiple networks
   - Comprehensive unit tests

3. **Backend Foundation**
   - Express server with security middleware
   - MongoDB models for Users and Certificates
   - Authentication routes with JWT
   - Certificate API endpoints
   - Error handling and validation

4. **Frontend Foundation**
   - React app with Material-UI theming
   - Complete routing structure
   - Home page with professional design
   - Layout components (Navbar, Footer)
   - Context providers (Auth, Web3)

## 🚧 Next Steps (Remaining 1.5 Days)

   - Blockchain service integration
   - Institution management routes
   - File upload handling for certificates
   - Email notification service

2. **Smart Contract Testing & Deployment**
   - Deploy to test network (Goerli/Sepolia)
   - Integration testing with backend
   - Gas optimization

### Day 2 (8 hours)
1. **Frontend Development** (4 hours)
   - Certificate verification interface
   - Certificate issuance form
   - Dashboard with analytics
   - Web3 wallet connection
   - QR code generation/scanning

2. **Integration & Polish** (4 hours)
   - End-to-end testing
   - Bug fixes and optimization
   - Demo data creation
   - Documentation completion
   - Deployment preparation

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Blockchain**: Ethereum (Hardhat development environment)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity ^0.8.19
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB

## 🎯 Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **Certificate Verification Interface** - Allow users to verify certificates by ID, hash, or QR code
2. **Certificate Issuance Interface** - Form for institutions to issue new certificates
3. **Blockchain Integration** - Connect backend to deployed smart contracts
4. **Dashboard Analytics** - Statistics and certificate management interface

### Medium Priority
1. **Batch Certificate Upload** - CSV/Excel import functionality
2. **QR Code Generation** - Generate QR codes for certificates
3. **Email Notifications** - Notify users of certificate issuance
4. **Advanced Search** - Filter and search certificates

### Nice to Have
